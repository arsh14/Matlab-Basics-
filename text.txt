Basic programming, use of basic functions of Matlab is shown.

Answers for the following questions are given:


1.Equation of a straight line is y=mx+c.Compute y coordinates of a line with a slope m=0.5,c=-2 at the following x coordinates and plot it.
x=0,1.5,3,4,5,7,9,10.

2.Create a vector t of 10 elements ie 1 to 10 and compute the value of x=tsint, y=t-1/t+1 and z=sin(t^2)/t^2 .

3.Let x=rcosa y=rsina where r^2=x^2+y^2 for a=0,pi/4,pi/2,3pi/4,pi,5pi/4 and r=2.Compute column vector for x,y and check if x,y satisfy equation of circle.

4.Form a random 4x3 matrix , vector v=0 to 12 and m=[sinv ; cosv] find size of m and v and extract the 1st 10 elements of each row and display them as column.

5.Plot (a)tsint (b)e^(-t) with the help of semilogx, semilogy and loglog.
